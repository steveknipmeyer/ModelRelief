<-- Tasks
    Goal : Roundtrip a scaled mesh.       
        Scale with a Python processor.

    Create ModelReliefBaseline.db from ModelReliefTest.db.

<-- Api Design

    Design the mechanism for creating a file-based resource such as a Model, DepthBuffer or Mesh.
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16877968/call-a-server-side-method-on-a-resource-in-a-restful-way

        Separate the file resource from the metadata.
                Resources   Models, DepthBuffers, (Meshes)
                File        /api/v1/<resource>/id/file                   
                Metadata    /api/v1/<resource>/id
        
        Mesh Generation
            Add a "synchronized" property that reflects whether the state of the mesh file matches the dependents.
                FileSynchronized
                Dependents
                    DepthBuffer
                    MeshTransform
                Whenever a dependent is updated, the synchronized property is set to false.

            Introduce specifif (POST) endpoint for Mesh generation actions.
                https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/338666/how-does-a-rest-api-fit-for-a-command-action-based-domain
                    POST /api/v1/meshes/id/generate
                    Mesh resources should not support POST creation since they are calculated on the server.

        IntegrationTesting Refactoring
        --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Rename tests to match new request nomenclature.
        Add file-based integration tests.

    How should file names and extensions be handled?

    Add authentication support!

    The Project is populating the object graph too deeply.

    Enhancements
        Express relationships as "href" properties to absolute URLs.
        Provide "reference expansion" to allow references to be expanded into the principal object.

    Stormpath Pattern
        Rich error message:
            Status Code         HttpStatusCode                   
            Code                ApiStatusCode
            Message             Errors[]
            DeveloperMessage    DeveloperMessage   
            API Reference       ApiReference



<-- Front End

    Create a ModelRelief JavaScript API library.
        Publish POCO models to JavaScript?
        Create a utility URL composer.

    File Transfer
        Use jQuery!
        Wait for file POST to complete before initiating the second metadata POST.

    async/await
        Refactor Export OBJ.

    Accessing Model From JavaScript
        https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16361364/accessing-mvcs-model-property-from-javascript

    Webpack

    Some Views are identical. Should they use a shared ViewComponent?
        Create, Edit
        Details, Delete

<-- Logging
    Review the ILogger interface. How should this work with a Controller?
        namespace Microsoft.Extensions.Logging
        {
            //
            // Summary:
            //     A generic interface for logging where the category name is derived from the specified
            //     TCategoryName type name. Generally used to enable activation of a named Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ILogger
            //     from dependency injection.
            //
            // Type parameters:
            //   TCategoryName:
            //     The type who's name is used for the logger category name.
            public interface ILogger<out TCategoryName> : ILogger
            {
            }
        }

<-- Exception handling
    The ApiValidationResult exposes too much about internals in the developer message (RequestType).

    How should database exceptions, such as those violating Domain DataAnnotation rules, be handled?
    https://andrewlock.net/using-cancellationtokens-in-asp-net-core-mvc-controllers/
    Concurrency exceptions?

    SqliteException: SQLite Error 5: 'database is locked'.
        PostFileRequestHandler : DbContext.SaveChanges();

    Throwing policy.
        https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2999298/difference-between-throw-and-throw-new-exception        

<-- Testing
    xUnit Async
        https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/1066

    Support database authentication.

    Integration Tests
        UserAuthenticatiosnException
        How can XUnit be used to test all properties of a resource?
            Iterate through the property list of a Domain model.
        Ux Endpoints                    
            Data must be form-encoded not JSON?
            The [ValidateAntiForgeryToken] attribute leads to an exception.
            Why is an exception thrown during the Razor compilation of the Error View?
        Split Api and Ux into separate assemblies?
            Can the ServerFixture be in a separate assembly?

            http://www.eq8.eu/blogs/36-patch-vs-put-and-the-patch-json-syntax-war

            PUT : complete
                The HTTP RFC specifies that PUT must take a full new resource representation as the request entity. 
                This means that if for example only certain attributes are provided, those should be remove (i.e. set to null).
            PATCH : partial

<-- Depth Buffer Notes
    Experiment with precision setting in THREE.WebGLRenderer.

    Precision is substantially improved by moving the Near plane as close to the model as possible.
        Pulling in the Far plane does not seem to improve the precision.

    The range of the depth buffer is based on the distance between the Near and Far planes. 
        If the Near and Far planes bound the model, the range will be [0.1].

<-- Database Design   

    Issues
        Analyze the correct behavior of OnDelete.
            Some dependent entities (e.g. Mesh) may potentially be deleted if the parent (e.g. DepthBuffer) is deleted.
        Referential Integrity!
        Should <all> entities have a direct relationship to Project or only "principal" entities.
            For example a Mesh is directly related to a Project but that relationship is also inditectly captured by Mesh->DepthBuffer->Model->Project.
        Should principal entities have a collection property that holds all children? These <can> be found with a query.
            For example:
                Project
                    Cameras
                    DepthBuffers

    http://davidbcalhoun.com/2014/what-is-amd-commonjs-and-umd/

    What is the recommended way to split a module over multiple files?
        Using a d.ts file and 'export as namespace' works but it led to issues loading MR in require.js. 
            modelrelief.d.ts
                export as namespace MR

                export * from "fileA"
                export * from "fileB"

            MR is composed of multiple disk files. How is that handled with AMD modules in require.js?
                When TypeScript creates the AMD output, the module name is the disk file. There is no definition of MR as an aggregate.
                Is there a require.config that maps a module name to multiple separate modules?
                    MR -> fileA,fileB
            
            Can a module name have a period such as MR.Graphics?
                import * as MR.Graphics from "Graphics" led to an error.

            Can multiple modules be imported into the same alias? This construct is not valid.
                import * as MR from"Graphics"
                import * as MR from"Views"

<-- THREE.js Notes

    Object clone <only> copies Object3d properties.

    Object matrices are updated only during the render loop. The property matrixAutoUpdate enables this update but not update the matrix when dependent properties are changed.
        Use Object3d.updateMatrixWorld(true) to force an update.

    A Group can belong to only one Scene.
        let sceneA   = new THREE.Scene();
        let theGroup = new THREE.Group();

<-- ASP.NET Core Model Validation
    https://github.com/JeremySkinner/FluentValidation/wiki/i.-ASP.NET-Core-integration

    Best Practices
        DataAnnotation rules also should be used for DTO.
            They <complement> FV. They (and any other registered validators) run after FV.
            They provide display formatting and other UX support.
        The Domain models should also use DataAnnotation attributes. 
            Validation will be done when a model (created OUTSIDE) the UX is transacted with the database.
            This happens as a part of model-binding.
        The DTO should expose only those properies which are editable!
            Missing properties in the View will override the target during mapping because they will have a default value.

    <---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
    Client-side Validation
        The View model (e.g. Dto.Mesh) determines the client-side validation rules.
            Any associated validators for this specific type will run.

        DataAnnotation Attributes
            Property ON form: A client-side error will be displayed and the controller action will not be called.
            Property not present on form: Validation will be done in the server IF the model-bound action parameter contains a validation rule. 
                ModelState will contain errors when the controller action is called.

            N.B. ContosoUniversityCore uses server-side validation (in conjunction with site.js and HtmlHelperExtensions error handling). 
                Any DataAnnotation attributes on the DTO are ignored. No data-val attributes are added to the View.
                    Is this because the jquery-validation-unobtrusive scripts are not include in the View page?
                If a DataAnnotation rule was violated (e.g. [Required]) and there was no FluentValidation (AbstractValidator rule), the property was not marked as invalid.
                * This seems odd because although the form did not contain the client-side validation attributes, why did MVC not validate the object on the incoming model-bound object?
                    Is this due to the custom model-binding?
                However, if the Domain model contains DataAnnotation attributes these are processed when the model is transacted to the database.

            [StringLength(50, MinimumLength = 3)]
            public string Name { get; set; }

        Aggregating Validation Rules
            If View model implements any of these interfaces then additional validation checks will be added the complete list of checks, adding additional results to ModelState.
                FluentValidation.AbstractValidator<T> : (runs first by default)
                DataAnnotation
                IValidatableObject 
            N.B. These are all used by a View if present! Each of these validations contribute rules (in the form of data-val attributes) that are used in the client-side processing.
    
    Server-Side Validation
        The controller action parameters (e.g. Create.Command) control the server-side validation rules.
            Any associated validators for this specific type will run.
            This happens during model-binding.

        Model-binding maps the Request.Body, route data and query strings to the parameters of the controller action. 
            By default, MVC supports a limited number of formatters.

        All validation providers can contribute rules to the validation.
            DataAnnotation Attribute
            IValidatable
            FluentValidation

    ValidationActionFilter
        If an ActionFilter is registered, control passes there.
            The ActionFilter can check ModelState.Valid and then set the ActionExecutingContext.Result so the controller action is never called.
    
    Finally, the controller action is invoked.

<-- Variance

    Invariance
        The types must match exactly.

    Covariance (out parameters) : More Derived
        public interface IEnumerable (out T)

        A more derived type can be substituted.
        The parameter can be returned because it satisfies the type because it is of type Base.

    Contravariance (in parameters) : Less Derived
        public interface IComparer<in T>

        A less derived type can be substituted.
        When the method is called, the <actual> parameter passed to the method will be <more derived> so it will satisfy the type of the actual method that is invoked.
