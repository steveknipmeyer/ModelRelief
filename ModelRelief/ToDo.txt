    Goal : Roundtrip a scaled mesh.
        Scale with a Python processor.

    Should the ValidationActionFilter return an application/json ContentResult (or the View)?

    How are related entities handled in Views?
        Add Model property for Meshes.
        Examine pure ContosoUniversity Course processing.

    Should the CQRS pattern be implemented in the core and then consumed by the API?
    
    Mediator Pipeline
        Should there be top-level logging and exception handling in a pipeline wrapper?

    ModelReliefModel
        Should ModelReliefModel be an interface instead of a base class?
            This would remove the need for virtual properties (supporting [Display (Name="")] attribute in the derived class.
            There is probably little benefit since the Domain model is never exposed in the UX.

<-- Depth Buffer Notes
    Experiment with precision setting in THREE.WebGLRenderer.

    Precision is substantially improved by moving the Near plane as close to the model as possible.
        Pulling in the Far plane does not seem to improve the precision.

    The range of the depth buffer is based on the distance between the Near and Far planes. 
        If the Near and Far planes bound the model, the range will be [0.1].

<-- Modules

    http://davidbcalhoun.com/2014/what-is-amd-commonjs-and-umd/

    What is the recommended way to split a module over multiple files?
        Using a d.ts file and 'export as namespace' works but it led to issues loading MR in require.js. 
            modelrelief.d.ts
                export as namespace MR

                export * from "fileA"
                export * from "fileB"

            MR is composed of multiple disk files. How is that handled with AMD modules in require.js?
                When TypeScript creates the AMD output, the module name is the disk file. There is no definition of MR as an aggregate.
                Is there a require.config that maps a module name to multiple separate modules?
                    MR -> fileA,fileB
            
            Can a module name have a period such as MR.Graphics?
                import * as MR.Graphics from "Graphics" led to an error.

            Can multiple modules be imported into the same alias? This construct is not valid.
                import * as MR from"Graphics"
                import * as MR from"Views"


<-- THREE.js Notes

    Object clone <only> copies Object3d properties.

    Object matrices are updated only during the render loop. The property matrixAutoUpdate enables this update but not update the matrix when dependent properties are changed.
        Use Object3d.updateMatrixWorld(true) to force an update.

    A Group can belong to only one Scene.
        let sceneA   = new THREE.Scene();
        let theGroup = new THREE.Group();
        sceneA.add(theGroup);

        let sceneB = new THREE.Scene();

<-- ASP.NET Core Model Validation

    A registered InputFormatter maps the Request.Body to a type. By default, MVC supports a limited number of formatters.
        This allows a strongly typed [FromBody] action parameter to be used.

    The DataAnnotation attributes (e.g. [Required]) are checked first and client-side validation will display the results on the form.
        Validation
            Property ON form: A client-side error will be displayed and the controller action will not be called.
            Property not present on form: Validation will be done in the server. ModelState will contain errors when the controller action is called.
        N.B. ContosoUniversityCore uses server-side validation (in conjunction with site.js and HtmlHelperExtensions error handling). The DataAnnotation attributes are not used.
            If a DataAnnotation rule was violated (e.g. [Required]) and there was no FluentValidation (AbstractValidator rule) the property was not marked as invalid.
            This seems odd because although the form did not contain the client-side validation attributes, why did MVC not validate the object on the incoming model-bound object?
            Is this due to the custom model-binding?
        
        [StringLength(50, MinimumLength = 3)]
        public string Name { get; set; }
    
    If the bound model implements any of these interfaces then additional validation checks may be performed, adding additional results to ModelState.
    N.B. These are all called by a View if present!
        IValidatableObject 
        FluentValidation.AbstractValidator<T>

    If an ActionFilter is registered, control passes there.
        The ActionFilter can check ModelState.Valid and then set the ActionExecutingContext.Result so the controller action is never called.
    
    Finally, the controller action is invoked.

<-- Logging

    Review the ILogger interface. How should this work with a Controller?
        namespace Microsoft.Extensions.Logging
        {
            //
            // Summary:
            //     A generic interface for logging where the category name is derived from the specified
            //     TCategoryName type name. Generally used to enable activation of a named Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ILogger
            //     from dependency injection.
            //
            // Type parameters:
            //   TCategoryName:
            //     The type who's name is used for the logger category name.
            public interface ILogger<out TCategoryName> : ILogger
            {
            }
        }

<-- Variance

    Invariance
        The types must match exactly.

    Covariance (out parameters)
        publi interface IEnumerable (out T)

        A more derived type can be substituted.
        The parameter can be returned because it satisfies the type because it is of type Base.

    Contravariance (in parameters)
        public interface IComparer<in T>

        A less derived type can be substituted.
        When the method is called, the actual parameter passed to the method will be <more derived> so it will satisfy the type of the actual method that is invoked.

<-- Tasks

        // prevent async (no await) warning

<-- ContosoUniversity Core
    Why is the project named "Core" when it has these dependencies? 
        AutoMapper.EF6
            EntityFramework 6.13

    Why does the ModelRelief Delete display the JSON ContentResult instead of the IndexView?
        The site.js file includes a jQuery call back on all form post submits.
        site.js provides client-side error validation.

    How is the ContosoUniversityCore model binding used?
        public class EntityModelBinder : IModelBinder
        It binds a database <model> looked up from the incomping Id.
