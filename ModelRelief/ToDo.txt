        This is an ASPNET Core issue. Works fine with pure JavaScript.

<-- Depth Buffer Notes

    Precision is substantially improved by moving the Near plane as close to the model as possible.
        Pulling in the Far plane does not seem to improve the precision.

    The range of the depth buffer is based on the distance between the Near and Far planes. 
        If the Near and Far planes bound the model, the range will be [0.1].

<-- Modules

    http://davidbcalhoun.com/2014/what-is-amd-commonjs-and-umd/

    What is the recommended way to split a module over multiple files?
        Using a d.ts file and 'export as namespace' works but it led to issues loading MR in require.js. 
            modelrelief.d.ts
                export as namespace MR

                export * from "fileA"
                export * from "fileB"

            MR is composed of multiple disk files. How is that handled with AMD modules in require.js?
                When TypeScript creates the AMD output, the module name is the disk file. There is no definition of MR as an aggregate.
                Is there a require.config that maps a module name to multiple separate modules?
                    MR -> fileA,fileB
            
            Can a module name have a period such as MR.Graphics?
                import * as MR.Graphics from "Graphics" led to an error.

            Can multiple modules be imported into the same alias? This construct is not valid.
                import * as MR from"Graphics"
                import * as MR from"Views"


<-- THREE.js Notes

    Object clone <only> copies Object3d properties.

    Object matrices are updated only during the render loop. The property matrixAutoUpdate enables this update but not update the matrix when dependent properties are changed.
        Use Object3d.updateMatrixWorld(true) to force an update.

    A Group can belong to only one Scene.
        let sceneA   = new THREE.Scene();
        let theGroup = new THREE.Group();
        sceneA.add(theGroup);

        let sceneB = new THREE.Scene();
        sceneB.add(theGroup);
